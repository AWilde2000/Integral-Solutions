## Introduction
Integral Solutions is a capstone group from the University of Maine. Our project is called POSAS (Programs of Study Approval System).

This capstone project serves as a step forward and a transition from the University of Maine’s physical storage of Programs of Study (POS) documents, to the digital storage of these documents. Specifically for the School of Computing and Information Science.

The system will house a given student’s current POS, as well as provide avenues for students and advisors alike to make changes to a POS. Signatures needed will be replaced with electronic signatures and greatly reduce the labor and overhead associated with both significant and insignificant changes alike.

This project is currently undergoing development and is scheduled to be completed in the Spring of 2022.
